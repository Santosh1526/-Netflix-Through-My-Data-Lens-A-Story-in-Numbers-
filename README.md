# **📊 Netflix Through My Data Lens – A Story in Numbers**


# 🔺When you open Netflix, you see endless titles.
When I opened the dataset, I saw a story waiting to be told.

I built this dashboard to explore how Netflix entertains the world—and here’s what I found:

# 🔺**It’s a platform where movies dominate with 4,265 titles, yet 1,969 TV shows hold their ground.**
# 🔺**It’s a place where Documentaries, Stand-Up Comedy, and International Dramas rule the popularity charts.**
# 🔺**It’s a catalogue shaped by audience maturity—TV-MA and TV-14 are the most common ratings.**

# **🎯The real twist?**
Netflix’s growth skyrocketed after 2015, peaking in 2019, showing how quickly it expanded to capture global screens.

From the US to Korea, from romantic dramas to kids’ TV—this dashboard maps Netflix’s global footprint, genre diversity, and strategic storytelling.
Behind every number is a show, a movie, and millions of viewers pressing “Play.”
